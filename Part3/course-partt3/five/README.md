**From course material:** _As you can see, even though our Jekyll image needed Ruby during the build stage, it is considerably smaller since it only has Nginx and the static files in the resulting image._

Notice the size of images generated by both Dockerfile1 and Dockerfile2 in this folder:

- size of `jekyll-img1` is without multi-stage build 1.08GB
- size of `jekyll-img2` is with multi-stage build is **only 192MB** ❤️

```bash
docker image ls | grep jekyll
# OUTPUT
# jekyll-img1 latest f05c533e443c 7 minutes ago 1.08GB
# jekyll-img2 latest e0319c7f6f0c 2 minutes ago 192MB
```
